Lab: 5


For this lab you'll be working with a simple implementation of a Genetic Algorithm.
In order to make things easy we'll use a starter code of GA implementation that can
be found on this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/genetic-algorithms/

For this task you'll understand the code in the link and modify to the following 
problem.

Consider 16 locations: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P
each of these locations can be accessed from one another. The optimal path to take
is: A, C, J, L, M, P. 
Modify the code in the link to implement GA on this problem.
Define what is going to be the length of the chromosome, the genes, do you need to change the
fitness function or not. Does increasing the population size or decreasing it effects the 
number of generations it takes to reach the goal.
